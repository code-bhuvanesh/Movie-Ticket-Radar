# 🎟️ Ticket Radar

**Ticket Radar** is a cross-platform Flutter application (Android & Windows) designed to help you catch movie tickets before they sell out. It monitors cinema booking availability in the background and notifies you the moment tickets open up.


## ✨ Features

- **Background Monitoring**: Runs efficiently in the background to check for tickets periodically (every 15 minutes).
    - **Android**: Uses a persistent foreground service to ensure reliability even when the app is closed.
    - **Windows**: Minimized to system tray monitoring.
- **Smart Notifications**:
    - **Android**: High-priority alerts with sound when tickets are found.
    - **Windows**: Native toast notifications.
- **Granular Control**:
    - Filter by **Date** (Specific dates).
    - Filter by **Time Range** (e.g., 6 PM - 11 PM).
    - Monitor specific **Theatres** or all theatres in a city.
    - Watch for specific statuses (e.g., "Available" or "Filling Fast").
- **User Experience**:
    - Clean, modern UI with Dark/Light mode support.
    - "Live" tab to view real-time show listings.
    - City selection and management.
